# ClimbOn
ClimbOn is an app for climbers.  The main idea that drives the app is making it easier to find climbing routes when you go climbing.
The app makes use of esri inc. mapping services Quartz Beta Android SDK.  As such, it is very much a beta product.

#Climbing Areas
Areas and routes are stored as hosted data on esri's servers.  This makes adding new areas and routes very simple.  However, this means the
data is not stored locally.  In future versions, I hope to add this functionality so that the app can fulfill it's potential.  Right now,
Joshua Tree, Yosemite, and the Riverside quarry are some of the areas that are funtioning.

#Routes
Right now, there are only a few routes that I put on for testing.  Eventually, I will add more. Plus I want to add the functionality where
a user out at Joshua Tree can add a route, and it will push to the server when they regain a data connection.  Esri's non-beta SDK has this functionality
but the beta does not right now.

#Current Issues
Mainly there isn't much data yet, and that makes the app feel a little empty right now.  

#Future Plans
In the near future, I want to add a search feature, and allow user uploads.  This way I can go out in the field and add routes quickly, and
somewhat importantly at accurate locations.  All of the locations in joshua tree are pretty accurate as I frequent those routes, but the santa
monica routes may be off.  I also want to be able to upload picture attachments to the routes.  

#Disclaimer
Rock Climbing is inherantly dangerous.  Always consider risks when climbing and take proper safety precautions. Do not rely on this or any 
other app exclusively.  Know where you are, know your surroundings and stay safe and have fun!
